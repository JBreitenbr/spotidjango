Given a string representing a binary number, return its decimal equivalent as a number.

A binary number uses only the digits 0 and 1 to represent any number. To convert binary to decimal, multiply each digit by a power of 2 and add them together. Start by multiplying the rightmost digit by 2^0, the next digit to the left by 2^1, and so on. Once all digits have been multiplied by a power of 2, add the result together.

For example, the binary number 101 equals 5 in decimal because:

For the final day of Space Week, you will be given the mass in kilograms (kg) of a payload you want to send to orbit. Determine the amount of fuel needed to send your payload to orbit using the following rules:

Rockets require 1 kg of fuel per 5 kg of mass they must lift.
Fuel itself has mass. So when you add fuel, the mass to lift goes up, which requires more fuel, which increases the mass, and so on.
To calculate the total fuel needed: start with the payload mass, calculate the fuel needed for that, add that fuel to the total mass, and calculate again. Repeat this process until the additional fuel required is less than 1 kg, then stop.
Ignore the mass of the rocket itself. Only compute fuel needed to lift the payload and its own fuel.
For example, given a payload mass of 50 kg, you would need 10 kg of fuel to lift it (payload / 5), which increases the total mass to 60 kg, which needs 12 kg to lift (2 additional kg), which increases the total mass to 62 kg, which needs 12.4 kg to lift - 0.4 additional kg - which is less 1 additional kg, so we stop here.

On October 28, 1994, Netscape Navigator was released, helping millions explore the early web.

Given an array of browser commands you executed on Netscape Navigator, return the current page you are on after executing all the commands using the following rules:

You always start on the "Home" page, which will not be included in the commands array.
Valid commands are:
"Visit Page": Where "Page" is the name of the page you are visiting. For example, "Visit About" takes you to the "About" page. When you visit a new page, make sure to discard any forward history you have.
"Back": Takes you to the previous page in your history or stays on the current page if there isn't one.
"Forward": Takes you forward in the history to the page you came from or stays on the current page if there isn't one.
For example, given ["Visit About Us", "Back", "Forward"], return "About Us".

On October 29, 1971, the first email ever was sent, introducing the username@domain format we still use. Now, there are billions of email addresses.

In this challenge, you are given a list of email addresses and need to sort them alphabetically by domain name first (the part after the @), and username second (the part before the @).

Sorting should be case-insensitive.
If more than one email has the same domain, sort them by their username.
Return an array of the sorted addresses.
Returned addresses should retain their original case.
For example, given ["jill@mail.com", "john@example.com", "jane@example.com"], return ["jane@example.com", "john@example.com", "jill@mail.com"].
