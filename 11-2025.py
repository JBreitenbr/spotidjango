In this challenge, you are given a number of days that have passed since an internet worm was released, and you need to determine how many computers are infected using the following rules:

On day 0, the first computer is infected.
Each subsequent day, the number of infected computers doubles.
Every 3rd day, a patch is applied after the virus spreads and reduces the number of infected computers by 20%. Round the number of patched computers up to the nearest whole number.
For example, on:

Day 2: 4 total computers are infected.
Day 3: 8 total computers are infected. Then, apply the patch: 8 infected * 20% = 1.6 patched. Round 1.6 up to 2. 8 computers infected - 2 patched = 6 total computers infected after day 3.

""" 30-11-2025: AI Detector
Today's challenge is inspired by the release of ChatGPT on November 30, 2022.

Given a string of one or more sentences, determine if it was likely generated by AI using the following rules:

It contains two or more dashes (-).

It contains two or more sets of parenthesis (()). Text can be within the parenthesis.

It contains three or more words with 7 or more letters.

Words are separated by a single space and only consist of letters (A-Z). Don't include punctuation or other non-letters as part of a word.

If the given sentence meets any of the rules above, return "AI", otherwise, return "Human"."""

def detect_ai(text):
    sp=text.split(" ")
    sn=0
    for i in range(len(sp)):
        if len(sp[i])>=7:
            sn+=1
    d=text.split("-")
    p1=text.split("(")
    p2=text.split(")")
    if sn>2 or len(d)>2 or len(p1)>2 and len(p2)>2:
        return "AI"
    return "Human"
