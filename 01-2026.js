/* 01-01-2026 Resolution Streak
Given an array of arrays, where each sub-array represents a day of your resolution activities and contains three integers: the number of steps walked that day, the minutes of screen time that day, and the number of pages read that day; determine if you are keeping your resolutions.

The first sub-array is day 1, and second day 2, and so on.
A day is considered successful if all three of the following goals are met:

You walked at least 10,000 steps.
You had no more than 120 minutes of screen time.
You read at least five pages.
If all of the given days are successful, return "Resolution on track: N day streak." Where N is the number of successful days.

If one or more days is not a success, return "Resolution failed on day X: N day streak.". Where X is the day number of the first unsuccessful day, and N is the number of successful days before the first unsuccessful day.*/

/* 03-01-2026: Left-Handed Seat at the Table
Given a 4x2 matrix (array of arrays) representing the seating arrangement for a meal, determine how many seats a left-handed person can sit at.

A left-handed person cannot sit where a right-handed person would be in the seat to the immediate left of them.
In the given matrix:

An "R" is a seat occupied by a right-handed person.
An "L" is a seat occupied by a left-handed person.
An "U" is an unoccupied seat.
Only unoccupied seats are available to sit at.
The seats in the top row are facing "down", and the seats in the bottom row are facing "up" (like a table), so left and right are relative to the seat's orientation.
Corner seats only have one seat next to them.
For example, in the given matrix:

[
  ["U", "R", "U", "L"],
  ["U", "R", "R", "R"]
]
The top-left seat is cannot be sat in because there's a right-handed person to the left. The other two open seats can be sat in because there isn't a right-handed person to the left.
